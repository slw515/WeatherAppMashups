This is a web application that combines real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API along with playlist on Soundcloud. The site allows users to input a city in the world and the present weather conditions will be displayed on the website. This site also uses p5.js, with visuals being generated to accompany weather conditions along with specific sounds. The sun and moonâ€™s position is also dependent on the current time where the user is accessing the website from. The speed of the clouds displayed on the p5.js sketch is determined by the current wind speed in the location selected. Users can play songs on the Soundcloud playlist to accompany the sounds and visuals that are used on the website depending on the weather.
